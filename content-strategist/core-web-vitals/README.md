    Write a blog post about the Core Web Vitals
</p>

# Challenge

As a Content Strategist, you will be responsible for creating content and ensuring consistency across all company 
communication channels (blog, social media, website, sales materials, etc.).

You received a briefing about core web vitals, a topic that has quickly earned attention in the digital marketing 
world. Your task is to write a blog post introducing the case for people who may not know it. You should also 
document the process you go through to create this post, from researching the topic to writing the final draft.

## Briefing

The requirements for this blog post are:

### Keywords

The post should include the following keywords:

- user experience
- page experience
- ranking criteria
- web vitals
- core web vitals

### Questions

The post should address the following questions:

- What metrics does Google use today to measure page experience?
- What does "Core Web Vitals" mean?
- What are the new "Core Web Vitals" metrics?
- What is the impact of this change on personalization strategies?

### Description

In May 2020, Google announced that its ranking algorithm would be updated to focus on user experience. One of the new 
algorithm's metrics is entirely in line with what we do and gives us a substantial competitive advantage due to how 
our software works. Most of the personalization tools on the market today emerged from the evolution of AB testing 
tools. A great example of this is Google Optimize.

Traditionally, personalization and AB tests are performed in the browser (client-side) and happen as follows:
1. The site loads with the default static content 
2. Using the browser's resources, the tool runs the test or evaluates what to display to the user and applies 
the corresponding content over the default site, shifting its elements 
3. After the content is loaded, the user sees the modified site.

Due to the delay between steps 1 and 3, users often notice the page reloads, which we call page flicker. This process 
changes the page's content, which means that tests and personalization impact the "Cumulative Layout Shift" metric.


#### How is this related to Croct?

The task here is to draw a detailed scenario with the main aspects of the Core Web Vitals, keeping it accessible 
for our reader to understand how it can affect personalization strategies.

We provide a solution for growth teams to create natively personalized applications that offer unique experiences 
for users according to their behavioral profile, interests, and browsing history. Our PMS (Personalization 
Management System) is like a content management system that allows them to dynamically display content without 
depending on developers to personalize and deploy it on each change.

Since Croct's PMS runs personalization and AB tests on the server (server-side), this happens as follows:
1. When starting to load, the website fetches the content to be displayed
2. Using server resources, the PMS runs the test or evaluates what to display to the user and provides the browser 
with the content to be displayed
4. After the content is loaded, the user sees the site.

From an SEO point of view, this process is much more suitable because:
- The user doesn't see two contents, just as he doesn't see the page "flicking"
- The site doesn't get heavy because it doesn't load two different contents, just the final content
- The performance of the site is much better since it doesn't run all the logic using the user's browser but 
using the Croct server
- Content does not change during load, not impacting the "Cumulative Layout Shift" metric.
