# Challenge

As an SDR, you need to fully understand your persona and be able to create good messages to get their attention and 
book a meeting.

You received 5 companies in your pipeline, and your goal is to pre-qualify them and reach out to those you believe 
makes sense. These are the companies:
- Contabilizei
- VWO
- CVC
- Cia Hering
- Convert

## Requirements

Completing the challenge will require you to:

- List the top 3 companies you would reach, indicating the priority and explaining your reasons
- Create two copy examples to use in a LinkedIn message for a Marketing Coordinator and a Head of Growth, 
  considering it would be the first contact channel
- Suggest other contact channels you would use rather than LinkedIn and email
- All in English 🇺🇸

You can use
[our success cases](https://blog.croct.com/tag/case-studies) and [this demo video](https://youtu.be/nsudSTeqK48)
to get a better understanding of the product. If you want to go further, we suggest you
