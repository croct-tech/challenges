# Challenge

As a Customer Success Engineer, you will be responsible for helping our customers to get the most out of our platform.
Supporting marketers and developers means being creative, thinking out of the box, and empowering them.

## Requirements

![Example](https://cdn.croct.io/assets/app/92894646-dc3d-4553-bfaf-194598f6aa4c/images/lp-react-personalization.png)

The marketing team has asked you to integrate a personalized banner on their website using our Personalization 
Management System (PMS).

The ultimate goal is to dynamically change the content based on the user's location without deploying a new version 
on every change or implementing a geolocation service.

For cases like this, we recommend using Croct, which allows the marketing team to change the content or personalization 
rules whenever needed without touching the code, exactly as they requested.

## Further Information

Here are some additional information you'll need to complete the integration:

- You can follow our [getting started guide](https://docs.croct.com/introduction/getting-started) to get familiar with 
  our product.
- Feel free to design the functionality and UI/UX of the app as you want, but keep in mind we're only focused on the
  personalization implementation
- You can implement it using the stack of your choice. The purpose here is to assess your technical skills and 
  understand how you deal with documentation
- If possible, test your application. We absolutely love well-written and tested code! üòç
- If you have any questions, we're here to support you! Please reach us on the `#challenges` channel in
  the [Croct Community](https://croct.link/community).

## Deliverable

Please send us the repository's link to jobs@croct.com, and we will reply to your email with the next steps in the
process.

We will do our best to review your project and get back with feedback on the result as soon as possible.
