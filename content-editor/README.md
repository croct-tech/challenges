# Challenge

As a Content Editor, you will be responsible for ensuring content is concise, straight to the point, and resonates with our audiences.

You received two blog posts written by one of our freelance writers. One is about [user-generated content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/160yeu9ygOQFk6cGWMLRwvua6DSsB1--SLuykjel5suY/edit?usp=sharing), and the other is about how [machine learning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zlcr0X6Xf9-tx87wdwm06EBxvGK6DklTvUyT52LvRnk/edit?usp=sharing) can leverage personalization marketing.

Your task is to make suggestions to improve both, so they have no grammatical errors or typos and follow [our brand voice guideliness](https://croct.link/brand-voice). Also, one of them was translated from Portuguese. Make sure that there isn't any sentence sounding literally translated since word-by-word translations may not make sense or sound natural compared to how native speakers would formulate it.

We strongly recommend you read other articles from our [blog](https://croct.com/blog) to get familiar with our writing style.

To help you understand the changes we usually make, we also provide you with [previously reviewed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ITny1TNSvEZ_9o2BK-B9ELjMJxRoTofMTaibFHQFk2Q/edit?usp=sharing) pieces of content with highlighted adjustments our content marketing team suggested.

> ⚠️  We will assess your skills based on the final content we'll have after accepting each of your suggestions, so don't be afraid to make as many changes as you think are necessary for an excellent blog post.
