# Challenge

As a backend developer, your task is to create a standalone application that translates IPs from a stream of events into another stream of geographical locations.

The input stream will be a sequence of messages with the following schema:

- **Client ID**  
  The ID of the client that emitted the event.
- **Timestamp**  
  The time in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.
- **IP**  
  The IP address of the user.

For the output stream should be a sequence of messages with the following schema:

- **Client ID**  
  The ID of the client that emitted the event. Same as the message that was processed.
- **Timestamp**  
  The time in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. Same as the message that was processed.
- **IP**  
  The IP address of the user.
- **Latitude**  
  The latitude coordinate of the user.
- **Longitude**  
  The longitude coordinate of the user.
- **Country**  
  The country of the user. For example, United States.
- **Region**  
  The region of the user. For example, California.
- **City**  
  The city of the user. For example, San Francisco.


# Requirements

The application should meet the following requirements:

- It must be standalone, meaning you should not use frameworks like Spring, Serverless, or Functions Framework, for example.
- It should produce at most one location per client and IP within a time window of 30 minutes.
  - This 30 minutes should follow, the timestamp of the messages, not the real world time.
- The translation of IPs to geographical locations should be configurable and you should include at least two of the following implementations:
  - Reading from a local SQLite3 database (provided here as `IPs.sqlite`)
  - Reading from a local CSV (provided here as `IPs.csv`)
  - Calling an external API  
    You can chose any external API, if the API requires authentication it should also be configurable, here are some examples:
    - [IPStack](https://ipstack.com/)
    - [IPApi](https://ip-api.com/)
    - [IPGeolocation](https://ipgeolocation.io/)
- The input stream should be configurable, you should include at least two of the following implementations:
  - Reading from a newline-delimited JSON file (provided as `input.jsonl`)
  - Reading from a CSV file (provided as `input.csv`)
  - Reading from a UNIX or TCP socket for newline-delimited JSON
  - Reading from a Kafka Topic (the key is the client ID, the value is a JSON without the ID)
- The output stream should be configurable, you should include at least two of the following implementations:
  - Writing to a newline-delimited JSON file
  - Writing a newline-delimited JSON stream to the standard output (your logging in this case must only go to the standard error)
  - Writing to a CSV file
  - Writing to a Kafka Topic (the key should be the client ID and the value should be a JSON without the ID)

Your implementations should be properly tested.

You can also use open-source libraries available in the community to help you with the project. Why reinvent the wheel, right? ðŸ˜œ
