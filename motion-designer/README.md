# Introduction


As a motion-designer at Croct, you will: 

- Help our customers understand the platform more easily through animations;
- Design commercial animations to promote product updates on social medias, email, blog and website;
- What does Croct do?
    
    Croct is a startup that focuses on improving the user experience through personalization.
    
    Using our platform, you can deliver a different experience to each customer simultaneously. It's like having a custom website for each visitor, but without the burden of maintaining multiple versions of your website.
    
    For example, imagine that a company wants to personalize a banner for pet parents who live in Florianopolis. Croct analyzes which people fit this audience and shows them the personalized variant.

    </p>

    Cool huh? With Croct it's possible! To create these personalized experiences, you need to tell who you want to personalize for (Audience ‚Üí Parents of Pet in Floripa), which place on your platform you would like to personalize (Slot ‚Üí Home banner), and what content you would like to show to that audience (banner with a cute cat).
    
    Below is a diagram explaining how to create an experience in Croct:

## Deliverable 1


**Briefing:**

Create an animation that briefly explains how personalization in Croct works. 

Here is the animation script:

2) ...the audience definition screen appears, showing the condition to participate (ex: liking cats, living in Florianopolis, etc)

3) Show the content definition

4) Show the experience going live 

5) Show that only users who fit that audience are seeing that experience.
