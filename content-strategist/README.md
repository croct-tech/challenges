# Challenge

As a Content Strategist, you will be responsible for creating content and ensuring consistency across all company
communication channels (blog, social media, website, sales materials, etc.).

You received a briefing about progressive profiling, a new strategy quickly gaining traction in the digital marketing
world. Your task is to write a blog post introducing the topic for people who may not know it. You should also document
the process you go through to create this post, from researching the topic to writing the final draft.

## Briefing

The requirements for this blog post are:

### Keywords

The post should include the following keywords:

- progressive profiling
- user profile
- anonymous tracking

### Questions

The post should address the following questions:

- What is progressive profiling?
- How do marketers use it today?
- How can they do this while the user is browsing?
- How can they gather user information gradually, in real-time, to personalize the communication?

### Description

Progressive profiling is a technique that allows marketers to continuously collect information on leads at strategic
interactions throughout the buyer's journey. It means requesting a few info at a time rather than asking for too much
all at once.

Croct is a user journey optimization platform. We serve both product professionals and marketers, i.e., people that
focus on user experience, onboarding, retention, recurrence, conversion rate, segmentation, lead nurturing, lead
acquisition, and growth.

When it comes to personalization, it all starts with understanding the users' needs. Without data, we can't comprehend
them and, therefore, customize their journey.

Our product automatically captures users' browsing data to build an anonymous profile associated with a journey that
includes all browsing history. It can happen over a single session or a much more extended period, such as months or
years.

Marketers have always used the term _progressive profiling_ to refer to the practice of progressively capturing data in
forms. The main goal is to prevent the user from providing the same information more than once and ensure to use each
opportunity to get to know more about him.

During some talks with our customers, it came to our min that progressive profiling is much more than just form data
collection. Our product allows marketers to enrich the user's profile throughout the navigation to understand their
interests and needs. It is progressive profiling 2.0.
