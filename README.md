    <strong>Croct Challenges</strong>
    <br />
    Have fun showing off your skills!
</p>

The Croct Code Challenges is a repository that houses technical challenges that resemble real-world challenges you may face in day-to-day work at Croct.

The goal is to test your in-depth knowledge of tools and technologies that you may frequently use. We don't believe there is a one-size-fits-all solution to any challenge, so don't expect to see one. We're looking for creative and innovative solutions that make use of the tools and technologies at your disposal. Exploring, digging, and breaking out of your comfort zone will most often lead to better outcomes.

### Evaluation Criteria

The Croct team will review your challenge based on the following criteria:

- **Clarity:** Does the README clearly explain the problem and solution?
- **Correctness:** Does the solution do what was asked? If anything is missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
- **Maintainability:** Is the solution simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?
- **Creativity** Does the solution take a creative approach to solve the problem?
- **Usability:** Is the solution approachable and helpful to users? Plagiarism will not be tolerated and will lead to immediate disqualification.
