# Challenge

As an account executive who recently joined the team, your task is to conduct a sales meeting to present Croct to 
a potential customer. The SDR assigned to this lead has already had a quick conversation with the person to qualify 
the deal, gather the necessary information, and provide you with all the details you need to create and deliver 
an effective presentation.

## Requirements

Completing the challenge will require you to:

- Create a few slides to back your presentation
- Record a video of up to 10 minutes with your presentation
- All this in English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

Besides the chat presented below, you can also use [our success cases](https://blog.croct.com/tag/case-studies) and 
[this demo video](https://youtu.be/nsudSTeqK48) to get a better understanding of the product. If you want to go further,
we suggest you [create an account](https://app.croct.com/) and explore the product yourself.

We don't require a minimum number of slides or minimum duration for the video. Our main goal is to evaluate 
your learning, synthesis, and communication skills ðŸ™‚
