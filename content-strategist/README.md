# Challenge

As a Content Strategist, you will be responsible for creating content and ensuring consistency across all company
communication channels (blog, social media, website, sales materials, etc.).

You received a briefing about privacy laws, a topic that has quickly earned attention in the digital marketing world. 
Your task is to write a blog post introducing the case for people who may not know it. You should also document 
the process you go through to create this post, from researching the topic to writing the final draft.

## Briefing

The requirements for this blog post are:

### Keywords

The post should include the following keywords:

- privacy
- data protection
- anonymous data

### Questions

The post should address the following questions:

- What are the main topics regarding data protection laws in terms of digital marketing?
- What are the roles of companies within the law?
    - Croct is the processor, while our client is the controller
- Which actions should companies take to adapt?
    - Companies should ask for consent and identify users
- What are companies allowed to do, considering the laws?
    - Collecting anonymous data
- Does it affect personalization?
    - It roughly doesnâ€™t if it only takes anonymous data to personalize the controllerâ€™s website
- How is Croctâ€™s positioning regarding this subject?
    - Croct keeps usersâ€™ personal information safe by not allowing access to anonymous usersâ€™ data

### Description

Marketers have many doubts regarding data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, etc.). One of the questions we frequently 
get from our clients is "_what should I consider concerning privacy laws before personalizing my website?_".

#### How is this related to Croct?

The task here is to draw a detailed scenario with the main aspects of the laws, keeping it accessible for our reader 
to understand which points from personalization can get affected by it.

According to the laws, all data that refers to a natural person should be considered personal data. First name, last 
name, phone number, email, etc., are good examples. Some data are not considered personal per se but may refer to 
a natural person when combined with additional information. Company name and title are good examples of this. Alone, 
they are not enough to correlate with a person of flesh and blood, but when combined, maybe. There is only one person 
that works as Head of Sales for Croct, for example.

By default, Croct only collects anonymous data from users: pages they've accessed, their geographic location (with 
a precision of city), device name, etc. Even combined, these data do not allow us to discover who the person who 
is browsing is. However, our SDK allows our clients (companies that use our platform to personalize their websites) 
to collect personal data and store it in the user's profile, like their name and email address.

## Requirements

Completing the challenge will require you to:

- Write the document and the blog post in English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
