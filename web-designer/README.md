# Challenge

As a Web Designer, you will be responsible for developing and ensuring consistency across all company communication 
channels (social media, website, and external presentations). For starters, your first job will be to analyze the 
Instagram and the website of one of the companies below. Document all your impressions based on design principles, 
brand consistency (between the analyzed platforms), and personal perspective.

- Quintoandar: [site](https://www.quintoandar.com.br/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/quintoandardesign/)
- Notion: [site](https://www.notion.so/product) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/notionhq/)
- Vtex: [site](https://vtex.com/us-en/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vtexbrasil/)

The second part of your challenge will be to redo this Croct post:

> **Context:** Croct's clients can access a table showing the main interests of their users so that marketers can make 
personalizations for different people according to their interests. It's not necessary to think about the caption.

- Write the analysis in English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
