# Challenge

As a backend developer, your task is to create a standalone [Kafka stream](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/) 
application that translates IPs into geographical locations using the [IPStack](https://ipstack.com/) free API.

</p>

The schema of the input topic is as follows:
- **Client ID**  
  The ID of the client that emitted the event.
- **Timestamp**  
  The time in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.
- **IP**  
  The IP address of the user.

For the output topic, the schema should be:

- **Client ID**  
  The ID of the client that emitted the event.
- **Timestamp**  
  The time in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.
- **IP**  
  The IP address of the user.
- **Latitude**  
  The latitude coordinate of the user.
- **Longitude**  
  The longitude coordinate of the user.
- **Country**  
  The country of the user. For example, United States.
- **Region**  
  The region of the user. For example, California.
- **City**  
  The city of the user. For example, San Francisco.

# Requirements

The application should meet the following requirements:

- It must be standalone, meaning you should not use frameworks like Spring, for example
- It should produce at most one localization per client and IP within a time window of 30 minutes
- Unit and integration tests covering all the requirements.

You can also use open-source libraries available in the community to help you with the project. Why reinvent the wheel, right? ðŸ˜œ
