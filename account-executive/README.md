# Challenge

As a new Account Executive, you are tasked with conducting a sales meeting to present Croct to a prospective client. 
The SDR assigned to this lead has already qualified it and gathered the necessary information  for you to create and 
deliver an effective presentation.

## Requirements

Completing the challenge will require you to:

- Create some slides to support your presentation
- Record a video of your presentation (up to 10 minutes)
- All in English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

Besides the [recorded call](https://cdn.croct.io/assets/sales/challenge-account-executive.mp3), you can also use 
[our success cases](https://blog.croct.com/tag/case-studies) and [this demo video](https://youtu.be/nsudSTeqK48) 
to get a better understanding of the product. If you want to go further, we suggest you 
[create an account](https://app.croct.com/) and explore the product yourself.

We don't require a minimum number of slides or a minimum duration for the video. Our main goal is to assess 
your learning, synthesis, and communication skills ðŸ™‚

## Deliverable

Please send us the slide and the video links to jobs@croct.com, and we will reply to your email with the next steps 
in the process.

We will do our best to review your project and get back with feedback on the result as soon as possible.
