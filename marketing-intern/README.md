# Challenge

As Marketing Intern, you will be responsible for creating content for the newsletter, social media, and communities 
while ensuring consistency across all company communication channels (blog, social media, website, sales materials, etc.).

The marketing team is constantly publishing new blog posts on [our blog](https://croct.com/blog).

Your task is to create a newsletter email to spread the content across the web, documenting the process you went through, 
from reading the blog post to writing the final drafts.

## Requirements

Completing the challenge will require you to:

- Create content for the newsletter email
- Write the document and the content in English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
- Create the MJML file based on the [email template](./template.mjml)
  - You can remove the code blocks you don't wish to use and keep those you'll use
  - If you don't use an IDE, we suggest using the [MJML Live editor](https://mjml.io/try-it-live/)
- Follow [our brand voice](https://croct.link/brand-voice).

## Deliverable

Please send us the MJML file and the document describing the steps to [jobs@croct.com](mailto:jobs@croct.com) in a
Google Docs document, and we will reply to your email informing the next steps in the process.

We will do our best to review your content and get back with feedback on the result as soon as possible.
